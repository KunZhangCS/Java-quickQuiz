# Java-quickQuiz

This is a program that delivers quick quiz questions via a classroom-based network-to a group of students.

The answers were checked and sent back to the main server simultaneously. I used dynamic data structures, hashing techniques, sorting algorithm and inter-process communication mechanism in this program.
